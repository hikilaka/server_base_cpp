server_base_cpp
===================
This is a collection of classes that makes up the beginning stages of a game server written in C++17. 

In the Makefile included in the project, you will find that I am using clang 4.0 with the c++1z flag enabled. I am also using Boost v1.62 in this project (as of right now any version >= 1.58 will work).
